# Drag and Drop

## Technologies
- html
- javascript
- css

## Purpose
- This is meant to act as a feature for use in landscaping visualization.  This allows users to upload an image of their home, and then apply landscaping features as a means of seeing what their home would look like with that investment.

## Lessons Learned
- I learned that you can use copy paste icons in html, I did not know this prior but there are paste-able options when it comes to placeholders.
- I used these placeholders because in a real application of this I would link the front-end to a backend for the landscaping options.

## How To Run
- download the test1.jpg for sample data (or upload a jpeg of your own house) nothing is saved, only proof of concept
- visit ```http://3.13.43.122```
- use the toolbar to choose item types, and sizes. Drag and drop from there and see how your house could look with hypothetical landscaping options
