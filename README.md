# Drag and Drop

## Technologies
- html
- javascript
- css

## Purpose
- This is meant to act as a feature for use in landscaping visualization.  This allows users to upload an image of their home, and then apply landscaping features as a means of seeing what their home would look like with that investment.

## Lessons Learned
- I learned that you can use copy paste icons in html, I did not know this prior but there are paste-able options when it comes to placeholders.
- I used these placeholders because in a real application of this I would link the front-end to a backend for the landscaping options.
